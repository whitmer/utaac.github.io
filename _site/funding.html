Utah funding grant with eligibility criteria. 
UATP’s financing options are offered in partnership with the Utah Assistive Technology Foundation (UATF), a private, non-profit organization organized in 1991 under the laws of the state of Utah. We also partner with Zions Bank for our AT loans and with the Utah Microloan Fund for our small business loans.

Over the years we have helped thousands of Utahns with disabilities of all ages obtain loans and grants to purchase the assistive technology that allows them to be more independent, productive and successful at home, at school, at work and in the community.
The Executive Director of the Utah Assistive Technology Foundation is Bora Lee.
