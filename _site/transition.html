      <p>Transitioning from a public school-provided AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) device to obtaining your own device for your child is an important step. Here are some resources and steps to help you in this process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Contact Your Child’s school team: Start by reaching out to your child’s team. In some cases, they may be able to provide guidance on the process of transitioning to a personal AAC device and may have information on funding options or loan programs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>School Transition Planning: Ensure that your child’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) includes a plan for transitioning from the school-provided device to a personal device. The IEP team can and should help you navigate this process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speak with a Speech Therapist or AAC Specialist: Consult with your child’s speech therapist or AAC specialist. They can offer recommendations on suitable AAC devices including low, mid, and high tech options based on your child’s specific needs and communication abilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistive Technology Evaluations: If you have not already, consider getting an assistive technology evaluation, which can help determine the most suitable AAC system for your child. The Utah Assistive Technology Teams can provide this evaluation for students throughout the state of Utah.
<a href="http://uatt.org/"></a>Utah Assistive Technology Teams&lt;/a&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li>Research Funding Options:
    <ul>
      <li>Medicaid or Private Insurance: Depending on your child’s healthcare coverage, Medicaid or private insurance may cover the cost of AAC devices. Contact your insurance provider to inquire about coverage and requirements.</li>
      <li>Medicare: If your child is 21 or older, they may be eligible for AAC device coverage through Medicare. Check the eligibility requirements and application process.</li>
      <li>State Assistive Technology Programs: Many states have programs that offer financial assistance or low-interest loans to help individuals with disabilities acquire assistive technology, including AAC devices. The University of Utah Utah Assistive Technology Program provides one of these options which can be accessed below.
<a href="https://www.usu.edu/uatp/financing/">Utah Assistive Technology Program Financing</a></li>
      <li>Non-profit Organizations: There are non-profit organizations that provide grants or assistance to families in need of AAC devices. Examples include Easterseals, United Cerebral Palsy, and local disability organizations. A list of some available grants can be found at the link below:

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AAC Device Manufacturers: Contact AAC device manufacturers directly. They can provide information on their products, financing options, and any available support or resources. Some examples include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.forbesaac.com/funding-portal">Forbes AAC Funding Portal</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.tobiidynavox.com/pages/funding">Tobii Dynavox Funding</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Online Communities and Support Groups: Join online forums, social media groups, or support networks for parents of children with communication difficulties. They often share experiences, tips, and resources for acquiring AAC devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>State and Local Agencies: In the state of Utah, programs such as Vocational Rehab, the Utah Center for Assistive Technology, and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services are available to support people with disabilities. They also offer guidance and resources for obtaining AAC devices.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://jobs.utah.gov/usor/vr/index.html">Utah Vocational Rehab</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://jobs.utah.gov/usor/vr/services/ucat.html">Utah Center for Assistive Technology</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://dspd.utah.gov/services/">Utah Department of Health and Human Services- Services for People with Disabilities</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Financial Assistance Programs: Explore programs and grants specific to your child’s disability. For example, if your child has cerebral palsy, organizations like United Cerebral Palsy might offer financial support. The University of Utah offers</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember that the process of obtaining an AAC device can vary depending on your child’s individual needs, your location, and your financial situation. Be patient and persistent in seeking out the resources and assistance available to help your child communicate effectively. Additionally, consider consulting with a lawyer or advocate who specializes in special education law to ensure that your child’s rights and needs are met during the transition. The Utah Parent Center is one organization that provides parent advocates that can assist parents through this process.
