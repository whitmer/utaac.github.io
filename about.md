We are a community of people from various backgrounds with an interest in improving AAC adoption in the state of Utah, and around the world.

AAC use is still uncommon enough that many people have never personally met an AAC user, or don't have any experience or support in interacting with them. Additionally, proficiency of training and supporting AAC use is not evenly-distributed geographically, and some areas still need help moving on from outdated ideas and practices.

We hope that this community of resources can help AAC be more impactful in the lives of Utah residents, by providing access to best practices, research approaches, and engagement and training opportunities.
