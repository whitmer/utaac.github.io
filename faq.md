**Will using AAC block progress with natural speech development?**
   Numerous studies have shown that AAC interventions can actually support and enhance natural speech development in individuals with communication disorders. AAC can serve as a bridge to improve communication skills and eventually reduce the need for AAC devices.

**If someone already speaks out loud, is AAC not allowed?**
   AAC is not limited to non-verbal individuals. It can benefit a wide range of individuals with communication difficulties, including those with speech disorders, language disorders, and cognitive impairments. Many AAC users call themselves "part-time" users because they only need help from AAC at
   certain times or in certain settings.

**Is AAC a last resort?**
   Early intervention with AAC has been shown to be effective in improving communication outcomes for individuals with communication difficulties. Waiting too long to implement AAC can hinder a person's overall communication development.

**Is AAC very expensive?**
   While some high-tech AAC devices can be costly, there are low-cost and even free AAC options available, such as communication apps for tablets and smartphones. The cost should not be a barrier to access.

**What if the default options, or the first attempt, don't work?**
   AAC systems can be highly customizable and adaptable to an individual's needs and preferences, allowing for a wide range of expression and communication styles. Adopting AAC can take time, and works better with consistent, positive support, so
   don't be afraid to keep trying!

**Is AAC only for children?**
   AAC can be beneficial for individuals of all ages, including adults with acquired communication disorders, progressive conditions, or degenerative diseases.

**Is it better to focus on regaining natural speech?**
  For acquired conditions like ALS or head injuries, AAC
  can serve as a short- or long-term element of a person's
  communication strategy. AAC can work in tandem with
  efforts to restore natural speech, or as a gradual replacement
  in degenerative situations.

**Is there a minimum age to start using AAC?**
  AAC can be started at any age, and has been used to support
  communicators younger than three years old.

**Is AAC a replacement for natural forms of communication?**
   AAC should be seen as a complementary tool that can be used alongside natural speech, sign language, or other forms of communication to enhance overall communication and interaction.
