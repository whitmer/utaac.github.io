<h2>Self-Reflection Resources</h2>

The <a href="https://www.openaac.org/cpp">Communication Partner Profile</a> is a self-assessment form you can use to think through how you are doing as an AAC helper, and consider areas where you may need to improve. It is free and open to share. Typically the full assessment take around 15 minutes, but it is designed to be used by therapists, family members, aides, and anyone else who acts as a communication partner for someone that uses AAC.
