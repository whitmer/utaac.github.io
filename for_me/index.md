<h2>AAC Basics</h2>

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is actually
a whole category of different kinds of tools and strategies.
The main purpose of AAC is to help people express themselves
when they may not always be able or comfortable using their natural voice. AAC can also help people develop a deeper
understanding of language, and make it easier for them
to express themselves. AAC is often printed on paper, 
activated by buttons that speak, or organized on a tablet or
phone for more advanced speech output.

AAC empowers individuals to convey their thoughts, needs, and emotions, which can lead to improved language development. It can serve as a bridge to gradually transition from non-verbal or limited verbal communication to more robust language skills, promoting social interaction and emotional well-being. Overall, AAC is a valuable resource that fosters language growth and enhances the quality of life for individuals with communication difficulties.

With the aid of AAC, many individuals enjoy full and productive lives, able to respond to questions and communicate independently throughout their days.

 <h3>Communication Bill of Rights</h3>
In collaboration the practitioners and AAC users, the Communication Bill of Rights was created to assert and remind that everyone, no matter their perceived limitations, should be treated with respect and be allowed the freedom to drive their own existence and interact with others through communication.

<h3>UATT Training Videos</h3>

The following are videos found on the Utah Assistive Technology Teams YouTube channel can be a place to start when learning about Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). They are between 8-20 minutes long and show about (1) language development, (2) what modeling language can look like as well as some of the (3) differences between communication and requesting. The videos then move into (4) teaching language and communication skills with more about (5) communication partners. Starting with the first three is a place to begin. 
Pause there and think about 1 or 2 things you can start to do in your home or school setting. These videos build your knowledge of AAC and language with these steps.

<h2>Self-Advocacy and Mentoring</h2>

While there are some online articles discussing self-advocacy for AAC users, most of them are focused on how therapists and families can encourage self-advocacy for AAC users. The ideas in these posts are still useful, however, and may give you some ideas of how you can increasingly advocate for yourself. We hope to add more communicator-centric resources over time.
