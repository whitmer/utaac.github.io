<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/07434618.2014.885080">Communicative Competencies</a> - there is more to communication than just knowing which words to say. Janice Light proposes 5 competencies, or skills areas, that AAC users need support to develop: Operational, Social, Linguistic, Strategic and Emotional.

<a href="https://aaclanguagelab.com/articles/myfilesMH2Prof?mode=view">Autonomy and Self-Determination Theory</a> - AAC users may not be able to accomplish full independence, but with support they can develop autonomy and be in control of their lives by making choices and directing the experiences around them.

<a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFbT9-6ExE/bdRp7SVEZ4psml7c2-2i4Q/view">Revisiting the Prompting Hierarchy</a> - The prompting hierarchy is a legacy tool still used in many settings to try to provide the "right" level of support to help in choice-making and communication. Forcing someone to do something with their body is not appropriate, but there are other considerations around this hierarchy as well.

<a href="https://www.hanen.org/information-tips/waiting-the-key-to-supporting-your-childs-communication">The Power of Waiting</a> - Wait times are an important part of communication, and people who use AAC may need their support team to learn to wait longer than they are used to. OWL is one strategy to help teach this important skill.
