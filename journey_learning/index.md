Below are some additional topics and learning sites that
may be useful once you've started down your AAC journey. There's always more to learn about AAC, and that can feel intimidating, but if you're patient with yourself and others, you'll learn that everyone can make a difference for AAC users, even if they don't have it all figured out yet!

<h2>Types of AAC</h2>

AAC is often separated into three different categories: low (or light)-tech, mid-tech, and high-tech. All three can provide significant value for different individuals. Here's a brief explainer of the three: <a href="https://www.autismadventures.com/low-tech-mid-tech-and-high-tech/">Low, Mid and High-Tech AAC options</a>

<h3>Low Tech AAC</h3>
1. **Communication Boards:** These printed boards contain symbols, words, or pictures that the individual can point to in order to communicate. If someone cannot point, a partner can assist them in finding or selecting the desired concept.
2. **Communication Books:** Books with pages containing various symbols, pictures, or words to support communication.
3. **Picture Exchange Systems (PECS):** A system where individuals use pictures or symbols to communicate their needs or desires.
4. **Choice Cards:** Simple cards with options or choices that individuals can point to.
5. **Gestures and Sign Language:** Simple hand signals or signs to convey basic messages.

<h3>Mid Tech AAC</h3>
1. **Speech-Generating Devices (SGDs):** Dedicated devices with synthesized or recorded speech output. Examples might include a BigMack button or a GoTalk device.
2. **Simple Voice Recorders:** Devices that allow the recording of short messages for playback.

<h3>High Tech AAC</h3>
1. **Tablet-Based AAC Systems:** Specialized software running on tablets that can be customized for individual needs.
2. **Communication Apps:** Apps installed on tablets or smartphones with text-to-speech functionality, such as Proloquo2Go or TouchChat.
3. **Eye-Tracking AAC Systems:** Devices that track eye movement to select symbols or words on a screen.
4. **Alternative Access Apps:** For those physically unable to use the touchscreen, SGDs offer flexible access options including:
Eye-gaze
Head tracking
Joystick and alternative mouse control
Single and multiple switch control
Thus, even children with severe physical disabilities can operate a life-changing AAC device.

<h2>Symbols and Text</h2>
Many forms of AAC use text or images (often called symbols) to show options for the AAC user to select. For some users, showing pictures may be easier for them to find and select, but words can be shown at the same time to gradually develop literacy. There are a number of different AAC symbol libraries available, some are free and some
are proprietary.

Much research has gone into what symbols work best for AAC users. <a href="https://www.janefarrall.com/what-is-beginning-aac/">Jane Farrall summarized some of this research here</a>. She observes that there is no evidence that more concrete symbols work better than abstract ones, and that often different types of symbols (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) are combined and taught at the same time. For many AAC users the meaning of the symbol is not as important as its consistent location and representation, which is what allows them to gain proficiency more easily.

<a name="modeling" style='margin-bottom: 50px; display: block; visibility: hidden;'></a>
<h2>Modeling</h2>
There are many terms in the industry used to represent a similar idea, sometimes called "modeling". The idea is that, just like with any other language learner, AAC users will get more comfortable and understand more about using their AAC system when they see others use it. As others provide examples of how AAC can be used to make requests, respond to questions, start conversations, express needs, etc. the AAC user can pick on strategies that will work for them individually. Ideally they would see others use AAC in multiple different settings and with multiple communication partners. 

AssistiveWare has provided some useful pointers for <a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/learn-aac/build-communication-partner-skills">developing communication partner skills for AAC learners</a>, including some additional jumping-off point links at the bottom of the article.

One researched approach to modeling is called <a href="https://talcaac.com/smorres/">SMoRRES - Slow Rate, MOdel, Respect and Reflect, Repeat, Expand, Stop</a>. During studies, parents significantly increased percentage of utterances modeled on their children’s SGDs between pretest and post-test measures.
Three of four child participants demonstrated increases in unique words used following parent instruction.

When modeling and teaching AAC, there can be a tendency to treat AAC use as an assignment or quiz. If you find yourself prompting an AAC user and expecting a specific correct answer, you may want to rethink your support strategy, as too much prompting can negatively affect the adoption of AAC.

<h2>Finding the Right Fit</h2>
<a href="https://atinternetmodules.org/storage/ocali-ims-sites/ocali-ims-atim/documents/AAC_Feature_Matching_Overview.pdf">AAC Feature Matching Module from University of Wisconsin</a> - Feature Matching is a collaborative process which involves using criterion-based assessment strategies to gather relevant information about a client’s communication and sensorimotor abilities and applying AAC expertise to match the appropriate array of AAC options that offer features relevant for meeting the person’s needs and skills.

<h2>Core Word Strategies</h2>
<a href="https://www.coreworkshop.org/">Core Workshop</a> and Project Core may give ideas on how to use some of these words in a new way. 

Welcome to The Communication Workshop! Here you'll find resources and ideas for introducing core words to developing communicators! The content on this site is free and open-licensed, and includes contributions from experts and community members from around the world.
Check out the activities and ideas for any word you'd like to focus on!

<a href="https://www.project-core.com/professional-development-modules/">Project Core - Professional Development Modules</a>

An overview of the multi-year, iterative development project to create the Project Core implementation model for teachers and classroom staff. Universal Core vocabulary, Aided Language Input (aka Modeling Language), Teaching Communication During Daily Routines and Academic Instruction along with Shared Reading are all integrated into these modules. 

Core words:

Some words feel like they have only one or two ways they can be used. Communication Workshop is a place to look at some of the core language that we use every day, core words that can be modeled in a variety of ways all day! 
You can use low or high tech AAC with any ideas shown here. An example can be <a href="https://www.coreworkshop.org/words/go/en">the word ‘go’</a>. Along with getting ready to ‘go’ in the car or making something ‘go’ there are many ideas to explore that can show how language can be used with this word.

<h2>UATT Training Videos</h2>

The following are videos found on the Utah Assistive Technology Teams YouTube channel can be a place to start when learning about Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). They are between 8-20 minutes long and show about (1) language development, (2) what modeling language can look like as well as some of the (3) differences between communication and requesting. The videos then move into (4) teaching language and communication skills with more about (5) communication partners. Starting with the first three is a place to begin. 
Pause there and think about 1 or 2 things you can start to do in your home or school setting. These videos build your knowledge of AAC and language with these steps.

About Us
USSAAC is an organization dedicated to supporting the needs and rights of people who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). It was established in 1991 as a national chapter of the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ISAAC)
Our community includes people who can benefit from AAC, family members, professionals from multiple disciplines, students, and AAC-related companies and institutions. Today, AAC strategies, tools and technologies enable more than 2 million children and adults in the United States to gain access to their human and civil right to communicate. AAC gives people with complex communication the means to exercise choice and control and to be active participants in their own families and communities.
USSAAC believes everybody has the right to communication and advocates for access to communication in all environments for people who use or need AAC. USSAAC supports a vision of a world in which:

<a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/blog/aac-terminology-survey">What AAC terminology should I use? - insights from a community survey</a>
Words can shape perceptions. In early 2022, AssistiveWare ran an online survey, asking people with a variety of relationships to AAC what they thought about 119 different words and phrases. The first research of its kind, our survey resonated deeply with the community—in total, 556 people participated. Now, considering the preferences of people who use AAC, their relatives, and AAC professionals, we can share our overall recommendations.
This poster shows the results of the survey.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nwacsfamily/">NWACS Family AAC Group</a>
Did you know? We have an NWACS Facebook group for parents, guardians, and other family members!
There isn't just one augmentative-alternative communication (AAC) system that is right for everyone. So this group does not focus on a specific communication system. The goal is to provide a safe and positive support network to ask questions, share, and connect with others.
This group is based in Washington State and centers the family perspective on AAC. However, other AAC stakeholders are welcome in the spirit of collaboration and shared learning.
